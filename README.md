# Battleships

A C based implementation of the classic game Battleships. This game involves two players and an assortment of ships. Each player is given their own set of ships (5) which will be of different variations. 

Each player will have an 8x8 board, where the y axis is referred to by letters (A-H) while the x axis is referred to by numbers (1-8). You will need to translate these coordinates for both a ship configuration board and hitboard.

Each player will have their own configuration of ships, each ship will have a vertical or horizontal configuration and the set number of spaces that they occupy.

Each player will get a chance to set up their ships prior to the game starting. Each player will need to set coordinates and an orientation for their ship. If the ship does not collide with any other ship that the player has and does not go outside of the bounds of the board, it will be accepted.
